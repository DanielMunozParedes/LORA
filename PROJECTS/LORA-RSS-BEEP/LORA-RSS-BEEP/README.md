# LORA-RSS-BEEP
Using Lora technology device: EBYTE E32 900T20D and Arduino IDE


Because the device 900t20d does not have RSSI integrated technology I decided to tacle this problem and trying to show (approximately) the best RSSI and that going to send a beep where if it goes faster it means the RSSI is optimal and if it goes slower that means the RSSI  is not good.

Code provided and verify the correct ports using ofr your implementation
